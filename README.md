# CV-Application

## This project is my first project developed with React.js
It was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) course. 
In this project, I worked with useState for the first time and focused on organizing the React component structure.

## Live Demo
You can view the live version of the project [here](cv-applicaton.vercel.app).

## Skills Practiced
- React(including state management with useState, component structure)
- CSS
